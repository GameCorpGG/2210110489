Document: I used Springboot to make the following project because I don't need to be worried about setting up the architecture for the project and just dive straight into the logic. In this project, I have 3 packages namely Service, Controller and Config. Config contains the logging middleware file. The URL which we set is shortened to the provided shortcode that we give in the response body. First we enter the URL, and then through the service, the logic for url shortening is done, and hence we can find a shortened URL. As for the info, due to time constraint, I cannot provide other information except the original URL.
